							<h4>In this blog, I address the following questions:</h4>
								<h5><ul>
								<li>Discuss how the marketing plan and organizational fundraising are interconnected.</li>
								<li>How would you use what you learned about marketing to create a plan for fundraising?</li>
								</ul></h5>
							
							<p></p><p></p>

<p>In the picture below, I have highlighted two diagrams from the textbook, Management and the Arts, that describe in detail the step-by-step process of fundraising planning and marketing planning. The highlighted portions show what is similar between the two diagrams. I have come up with some generalizations about what is similar between planning diagrams according to our textbook.</p>

<ul>
<li>An organization's Mission, Vision and Values must be made in order to complete operational plans. </li>
<ul>
<li>This will help guide the plan to completion and keep the plan on track and in alignment with the organization's true goals.</li>
</ul>

<li>Next, an analysis of the "Programs of activity" to be completed must be done.</li>
<ul>
<li>Again, this step with help align the planning process with the organization's overall mission and help get a view of what the organization is already in the process of planning and organizing.</li>
</ul>

<li>An analysis of needs and the environment of the organization is necessary in order to create a successful plan of action for either marketing or fundraising.</li>
<li>The plan development is very similar on both sides, but the marketing plan has the bullets listed further down the list than the fundraising diagram.</li>
<ul>
<li>Establish specific objectives</li>
<li>Create a "Case for Support" or a detailed action plan</li>
<li>Create a system for data gathering</li>
<li>Formulate/design strategies</li>
<li>Establish the number of people needed</li>
<li>Establish the estimated budget needed</li>
<li>Formulate a timetable/calendar for the plan</li>
<li>Be able to adjust the objectives and strategies as needed</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>The difference between these two diagrams and planning charts is how the plan is implemented within the community and organization. The fundraising plan will focus more on how to get gifts from potential donors while the marketing plan focuses more on how to reach a specific audience or the widest audience possible (which could also be true of the fundraising plan). I believe a successful fundraising plan will come from an already successful marketing plan, as the two are interconnected in function, as shown in my above analysis. There will not be a successful raising of funds without the means to get the message out in to the community that an organization needs new funding. </p>

<p>I found a PDF that is very clear and helpful on how to start a marketing campaign for a nonprofit organization called, "7 Steps to Creating Your Best Nonprofit Marketing Plan Ever." The steps are as follows:</p>

<ol type="1" > 
<li>Perform an organization self-assessment. </li>
<li>Set goals and strategy</li>
<li>Determine your unique value</li>
<li>Craft your message</li>
<li>Choose your tools</li>
<li>Define budget, timeline, resources</li>
<li>Track and measure your results</li>
</ol><p>This list confirms my thoughts about what a general plan should look like and how marketing plans and fundraising plans are connected. </p>

<p>If I were to create a plan for fundraising, I would first make sure my organization's marketing plan is well implemented and running smoothly with data that shows the plan is working. After this, I would essentially follow the "7 Steps" in order to create a successful fundraiser. However, the steps would be tailored specifically to a fundraising campaign, meaning each step will be working towards a goal of raising funds and attaining new donors. This means I would focus the plan to show the community why this campaign is important, how it benefits the community at large, and what they specifically can gain from donating to the cause. Some of these benefits will be shown through crafting my organization's unique value and presenting it in a way that shows our message, while others can be shown through emails, postings, tweets, etc. in a more personalized way in order to gain potential donors. </p>

<p>Most importantly, the key to a successful fundraising campaign is transparency of the fundraising goals and implementation. This will gain the community's trust and potential donor's trust and will therefore be more willing to donate their time and money to my organization's cause. </p>
