title:  "Strategic Planning and Market Management"

<p>The marketing management process can be summed up as achieving organizational objectives through the process of planning, analyzing, implementing, and controlling programs designed to build and maintain positive exchanges with the company's target buyers. The strategic planning process is defined as the, "process of developing and maintaining a strategic fit between the organization’s goals and capabilities and its changing marketing opportunities" (DocSlide PPT).</p>

<p>These two processes are related because both strive to develop and maintain a certain aspect of the company. Marketing happens to relate more to the consumer base of the company's goals, while strategic planning is involved more with the organization as a whole and how it's goals are being realized by the marketing strategy used. Overall, both processes are methods used to grow and maintain the company and it's consumer base in order to grow profits and to adjust to a changing world with new opportunities.</p>

<p>While researching, I found this image that nicely shows how the strategic planning process is used.</p>

<p>I also really like this flow chart for the marketing management process:</p>

<p>Both flow charts ask similar questions: Where are we now? Where should we be going? Etc… Also, each have goals and a way to achieve those goals, either through planning or through the 4 P's process (also described on the powerpoint link for Chapter 2). Overall, both charts focus on the Company, the Competition, and the Customers. I would say these 3 C's are the main similarities between these two processes.</p>

<p>These values can also be seen in not just consumer based retail stores, but performing arts centers like Krannert. Krannert is heavily involved with the 3 C's of maintaining and managing the company, analyzing the competition in order to maintain ticket sales, and marketing to the customers to grow an audience base. This can be seen through Krannert's yearly publication of their events in a book, their website, advertisements in print and online, through word of mouth, etc. The strategic planning of Krannert is closely involved with the marketing of Krannert in this way.</p>
