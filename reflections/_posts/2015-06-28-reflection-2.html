				<h4>In this lesson reflection post, I have written a summary of the course content for that week and addressed the following questions:</h4>
					<h5><ul>
					<li>Conduct a summary SWOT Analysis for your organization.</li>
					</ul></h5>

<p>In Lesson 2, I learned about strategic planning within organizations and especially non-profit organizations within the arts. This involved learning extensively about mission statements, vision statements, and what values organizations should have when creating these statements. In Chapter 4 of <u>Management and the Arts</u>, I also learned how assessing the environment that the organization is situated in can affect the mission/vision statements and how the organization addresses the community through engagement and programming. Assessing the environment can include a content analysis through online researching, and assessing information sources through the media and other arts organizations. In Chapter 5 of <u>Management and the Arts</u>, planning was the main focus. This included everything from the basic definitions of different types of planning, to very detailed descriptions of how to plan within arts organizations. My favorite quote from this chapter is, "Planning is 80% thinking and 20% writing. Then 100% doing!"</p>

<p>Overall, a mission statement cannot be fulfilled without necessary planning. This planning should not just involve upper level management, but then needs to involve middle and lower management levels, including the staff and personnel in order to be successful. Planning can either go from bottom-up or top-down, and usually involves a mixture of both when this type of planning is most successful.</p>
