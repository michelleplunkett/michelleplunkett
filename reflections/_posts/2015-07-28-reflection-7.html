				<h4>In this lesson reflection post, I have written a summary of the course content for that week and addressed the following questions:</h4>
					<h5><ul>
					<li>Please project how you think your organization will change over the next 20 years and offer a justification.</li>
					</ul></h5>
					
<p></p><p></p>

<p>In lesson 7, I learned about organizational cultures and the types of changes that can affect an organization. We also discussed an article about changes in the arts called, "The Death of the Artist - and the Birth of the Creative Entrepreneur." Chapter 6 of <u>Management</u> discussed the change process and possible factors that create or affect change in an organization while chapter 2 (p. 51-60) of <u>Management</u> discussed organizational culture and possibly ways and organizational culture is created and changed. An organization can change from either external or internal factors like technological or economical changes, or internally, a new organizational strategy. Finally, I learned about types of organizational change, why people resist change, and ways to motivate employees either to create change or stimulate innovation and creativity.</p>

<p>There are three main types of change that an organization could potentially encounter. These include changes in technology, people, or the structure of an organization. Since Krannert is an arts organization, I believe all three of these changes could affect the way Krannert operates. Overall, I believe that the majority of the changes that will occur at Krannert in the next 20 years are technological in nature.</p>

<p>For example, technological advances (especially in theatre) could require new equipment or methods on how Krannert is run. There could be new advances in how lights are run within a theatre, or new sound technology that needs to be implemented in order to be competitive with other arts organizations and performing arts centers. I definitely think that Krannert will be affected by technological advances and changes for as long as it exists. However, these technological changes could also affect employees behaviors and attitudes. I personally know many adults that are resistant to change, especially involving technology.</p>

<p>Changing people can change the way Krannert is run too, especially with a new generation going into the workforce. Younger people who grew up in the late 20th and early 21st centuries will be more adaptable to a changing environment, especially in terms of changing technology, than an older demographic. Also, having a younger workforce join an organization could possibly change the attitudes of the older employees in the company and may affect their behaviors and perceptions. In order to reverse these feelings that could develop throughout the organization, Krannert could implement an organizational development method through team building, surveys, training, etc. However, these techniques could be implemented throughout a 20 year span rather than all at once in order to maintain stable relationships in the workplace. </p>
