				<h4>In this lesson reflection post, I have written a summary of the course content for that week and addressed the following questions:</h4>

					<li>Now that you understand the distinct differences between a profit and nonprofit organization, briefly explain how each measures success.</li>

					</ul></h5>

<p>In Lesson 1, we learned about the key terms and the historical context of nonprofit and for-profit arts. I learned from Management and the Arts the trends that have occurred in the business of arts and entertainment, the levels of management within an arts organization and how it affects the organization as a whole, and how arts organizations are formed and maintained. In The Performing Arts in a New Era, I learned about the trends in 4 aspects of the arts: audiences, artists, arts organizations, and financing.

<p>The most interesting part of this reading to me was learning about "the new model of organization" within arts organizations. I did not know before this reading how arts were treated in society in the 20th century, and how the separation of popular and "high" arts came to be. Also, learning about the Ford Foundation's goals and the effects that it had on the arts as a whole was very interesting. I wondered how the goals of the program affected what was programmed on symphonic concerts, and even what was composed. The separation of popular and "high" arts in the 20th century could have affected what was created and what was composed. If the separation did not happen, we could be living in a very different world, artistically.

<p>The main difference between a profit and nonprofit organization is that a nonprofit organization is in some way "fulfilling a public good" or need. Also, a nonprofit organization is usually tax exempt (after the organization applies) while a for-profit is not. A for-profit organization is deemed successful if they are making a profit from their organization's main form of business. A nonprofit organization is successful if they are fulfilling the publics need for something. Also, through this success, they gain the publics support through attendance and donations or contributions. Also, a nonprofit could also be deemed successful if it needs more space or employees to conduct the business. However, a for-profit could also be deemed successful in this way. A nonprofit could also be successful if the entertainment (or other business) that it conducts makes enough money from the event to break even on the amount that it cost to present the entertainment to the community.
