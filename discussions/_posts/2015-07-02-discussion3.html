				<h4>In this discussion post, I address the following question:</h4>

					<h5><ul>

							<li>What do you think is the core benefit that your organization offers?</li>

					</ul></h5>

<p>The core benefit my organization offers is the availability of a wide range of "high" arts and popular arts performances to the surrounding community. Along with this benefit, the community will become more engaged with the arts through the wide offering of different types of programming and learn more about the arts in this way. A lot of times, a performing arts venue will only show 1 type of performance (plays, classical music concerts, etc), but at Krannert, all types of performances are held; even interpretive dance performances are conducted in the lobby (Stage 5).</p> 

<p>To me, the main benefit that Krannert offers is the programming of "high" arts performances at the professional level, like the ability to see the San Francisco Symphony or the Chicago Symphony Orchestra perform in our own college town. This makes the affordability of seeing world-renown musicians perform reasonable and also more accessible as we do not have to go to San Francisco to see their symphony perform this way.</p>
