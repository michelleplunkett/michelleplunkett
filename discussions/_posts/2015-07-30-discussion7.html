							<h4>In this blog, I address the following questions:</h4>
								<h5><ul>
								<li>Can you ascertain from research what your chosen organization's culture might be?</li>
								<li>What type of organizational culture do you think would be best for your organization?</li>
								</ul></h5>
							
							<p></p><p></p>
							
<p>An organizational culture is one that is described as, "the shared values, principles, traditions, and ways of doing things that influence the way organizational members act" (<u>Management</ul>). Some things that are involved with the creation and development of an organization's culture are symbols throughout the company, the organizational structure of the business, the routines of the employees, the organization's mission &amp; vision, etc.</p>

<p>I particularly like this quote from the "Parents &amp; Educators" subpage on Krannert's website that captures the employee's views about Krannert: "At Krannert Center, we’re devoted to making the arts accessible to everyone, and we’re particularly excited when young people feel the energy and positive benefits from being inside the arts." From this quote, I can interpret these things about the employees who work there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devoted to making the arts accessible</li>
<li>Creating a positive environment to experience the arts </li>
<li>A team atmosphere (through all-inclusive words like "we're")</li>
<li>A sense of agreement about Krannert's mission (through team inclusivity and the statement as a whole)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other phrases that catch my eye about how Krannert's employee's culture might be include:</p>

<ul>
<li>With its comprehensive services, Krannert Center is nationally recognized as a welcoming space. </li>
<li>Take full advantage of us. We want you to.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these phrases I can ascertain that Krannert and its employees create a welcoming environment with a customer service based attitude. It seems that it's clear (at least from the website) to the employees and to future customers what Krannert has set out to do (their vision) and what they're doing to maintain the organization and work toward this goal of making arts a main part of our community.</p>

<p>All of these phrases I have mentioned above are shared values that influence the way employees act in Krannert. Each day, every employee of Krannert is working in some way to make the best arts experience possible for a student, youth, customer, etc.</p>

<p>In further research (not on Krannert's website) I have found descriptions of types of organizational cultures that one might find. I think this one could fit Krannert's environment well:</p>

<p><ul><b>Bet-the-company culture:</b> This has slow feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and delay before knowing if actions have paid off. The long view is taken, but then much work is put into making sure things happen as planned.</ul></p>

<p>This could relate to Krannert's organizational culture because of the events that Krannert plans. The "long view" is taken when planning performances, especially for renowned groups or artists such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra or Sir James Galway (both of which performed at Krannert last season). When the event finally comes to Krannert, there is a lot of work that is done to make sure the event or concert runs smoothly. Volunteers must be organized, employees scheduled, food bought, tickets printed, etc. From this analysis, the culture within the organization might be high-stress because of the long-range thinking and planning but short term rewards. For example, planning an event 2 years in event, but the event only lasts 3 hours. That could be potentially stressful on an employee and therefore the culture within the organization could be stressful and uptight.</p>

<p>However, I believe that even though the events that Krannert puts on every season are high stress, the employees all have a sense of belonging and community in the fact that they are all working towards a the same mission and vision, which is definitely made clear on Krannert's website.</p>

<p>Final tidbit: I just noticed today that Krannert's logo has a little heart like symbol in the middle of where the lines meet. This could be another way that Krannert shows that they are dedicated to their involvement within the arts and making the arts available to the community. </p>
