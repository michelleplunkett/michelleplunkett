							<h4>In this blog, I address the following questions:</h4>
								<h5><ul>
								<li>Based on this module's reading and what you know about your chosen organization, what type of organizational structure might they have?</li>
								</ul></h5>

<p>According to the Krannert website's subpage listing of staff member's names and biographies, employees are placed into groups or departments. This means that Krannert's organization structure is based on a "divisional structure" where employees are grouped into separate business units and divisions. Specifically, I believe that Krannert Center functions under the specific, "Product Departmentalization" divisional structure. Meaning that each department is under control of one product that the business creates and is overseen by a manager of that department.</p>

<p>According to a website I found and the <u>Management</u> textbook, some advantages to having a divisional structure include accountability of each department to manage and create their individual product and it affords greater flexibility within each department. However, along with these advantages comes problems like a lack of communication between departments or redundancy among work efforts.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the departments that Krannert has divided their employees into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Senior Management</li>
<li>Director's Office</li>
<li>Marketing and Patron Services</li>
<li>Ticket Office</li>
<li>Promenade</li>
<li>Food Services</li>
<li>FAA IT Liaisons </li>
<li>Business Office</li>
<li>Building Operations</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Production</li>
<li>Development</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of how I think a hierarchical diagram would look for Krannert (This is just my idea, not necessarily how Krannert is run currently.):</p>
