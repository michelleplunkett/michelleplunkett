				<p>The prices increased because the people who chose to continue to support the "high" arts had to accept higher prices in order to maintain the supply of the art that they preferred. This was also when the new model for arts organizations began to develop. Nonprofit arts organizations were now a way for people to distinguish themselves in society through their tastes in art.</p>
				
				<p>I believe that the Krannert Center (opened in 1969) was most affected by the Ford Foundation movement in the 1950s. The creation of Krannert allowed Central Illinois to be a highly functioning supporter of the "high" arts by providing a regional destination for artists previously based of out NYC or other metropolitan areas. However, I do think that Krannert was affected by the split between "high" arts and "popular" arts. This is seen through the gradual rise in prices despite the "high" arts growth throughout the second half of the 20th century.</p> 
				
				<p>For example, the price of admission for a UI Student for the "Dedication Concert" at Krannert on April 19, 1969 was $1.50 and $2.50 for the general public which can be seen in the picture below (Dedication Concert Tickets, 1969). With inflation accounted for (by using an inflation calculator), the price would still only be $9.67 if a similar UI Student ticket was sold today. This is especially remarkable because this is almost the current price of a UI Student ticket, which is $10 for most events and concerts. The dedication of Krannert to maintain a low cost of admission for current UI Students is unmatched.</p>
				
				<p>However, not only was this the dedication concert held to open Krannert officially, but the concert featured famous musicians like Tossy Spivakovsky (a virtuoso violinist). Spivakovsky, most likely, was not cheap to hire even in the 1960s. So it is impressive that the cost was still low to attend the dedication even when renowned artists were invited to perform.<p>

				<p>However, nowadays, a ticket to attend a concert at Krannert at the same magnitude of the 1969 dedication concert will set an adult back around $50 today ($7.76 in 1969). So, the cost of a ticket to attend a comparable event at Krannert today is around 3 times more expensive ($7.76 divided by $2.50) than when Krannert first opened. The price increase is very clear when put in this context. However, it is worth noting that the price could have been lower for the Dedication Concert through the support of sponsor funding and from Mr. and Mrs. Krannert's direct contribution. But I think the price increase seen in this example is still relevant.</p>
				
				<p>I think that the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts presents a combination of popular arts and high arts. Krannert features classical music from world-renown symphonies and orchestras while also embracing a popular music culture. Popular music can be seen at the biyearly guitar festival held at Krannert called ELLNORA. Artists that are not considered to be "high" art can be seen at this festival like the Punch Brothers and Bela Fleck. (Speaking of which, ELLNORA is named after Mrs. Krannert, whose first name is Ellnora.) However, during the August-May school year, I do think mostly "high" art like classical music concerts are featured, especially since our own School of Music uses Foellinger Great Hall almost exclusively for major ensemble concerts.</p>
				
				<p>Here's a bonus picture of the construction on Krannert's Great Hall, just because I think it is super cool and interesting.</p>

				<p>By the way, for anyone who is wondering, I received these pictures and information about Krannert from the UIUC Archives while I was doing research for RHET 105 (a freshman writing course). There is a scrapbook currently held in the UIUC Undergrad Library Archives that contains all of the newspaper clippings and items (like the tickets I feature in this post) from the grand opening of Krannert. I would highly suggest checking it out if you have some free time!</p>

			<h4>June 24, 2015</h4>
				<p>As found in the Ziff Marketing, Inc. survey mentioned in Chapter 4 of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Management and the Arts</span>, I think that Krannert's attendance is largely affected by peer group influence. When I have asked my older coworkers why they attended a certain show at Krannert, many of them will say, "because my friend invited me," or because their friend told them about the show and recommended it to them. I have found in my own experience that people who did not "grow up" in the arts like most music students, like myself, find their way into the arts through being invited to an event.</p>
				
				<p>That's why I think the events that Krannert is now holding after certain events to meet the musicians is very important to grow audiences. Events like the meet and greets that were held last season make the musicians and performers more accessible to people who have previously not had that much exposure to classical music or  the theatre.  I think part of the reason these events are so successful is the social accessibility of audience members to the performers. If an audience member was invited to attend an event at Krannert with a meet and greet scheduled to occur right after the event concludes, I think they will be more likely to attend another show or concert at Krannert in the future.</p>
				
				<p>In terms of other social factors, I think the Champaign-Urbana community is a relatively "open-minded" community with a more liberal mindset. This can be seen through a number of non-traditional events that Krannert holds every year. Champaign-Urbana also is open and accepting to the gay community, offering gay bars like "C-Street" and other accepting events held in the community. This being said, I do not think Krannert is affected by any particularly negative social trends and is accepting of homosexuals and not repressed by religious beliefs within the community.</p>
				
				<p>Overall, I do not think any major cultural or social trends affect Krannert's programming.</p>
