* How might external factors affect human resource management in your chosen organization?

According to Chapter 12 of Management, there are four main external factors that affect Human Resource Management (or HRM).

1. The economy
2. Employee labor unions
3. The legal environment of HRM
4. Demographic trends

In my chosen organization, Krannert Center, I can see how a couple of these external factors might affect HRM more than others. For example, demographic trends can be seen currently in how Krannert operates and how it affects HRM. As the classical concert attendee grows older, so do the volunteers. Krannert's Human Resources is able to maintain an older generation of volunteers and employees through maintaining handicap accessibility and providing adjustments to where a volunteer works or how an employee works throughout the day. These adjustments can be seen through handicap accessible building access, accessible restrooms, and possibly more supportive chairs and cushions for older employees who work full-time. These modifications to Krannert's environment, through the help of human resources, allows Krannert to maintain an older customer base and older employee demographic. Accessibility is even a subpage featured on Krannert's website. Their main accessibility focuses are these things: parking, building entry, easy-access seating, and vision/hearing services. These are all factors that affect an aging audience and things that Patron Services and Human Resources has considered effectively.

As for other external factors, I think another factor that could affect Krannert is the legal environment of HRM involving the hiring process. Affirmative action is involved with HR in almost any place of employment, and Krannert is not an exception. This means that as long as person's personal beliefs or current state do not conflict with the safety of their job, an employer can not base an employment decision based on factors like race, sex, religion, age, color, national origin, or disability.

Finally, I do not believe that Krannert's employees are unionized, so I do not think the external factor of employee labor unions affect Krannert greatly. However, outside sources of performers do deal with unions. For example, Equity actors are union based, and Krannert could potentially contract an Equity actor for a performance. Other arts professionals like musicians could also be involved with a union. The terms of the contract will therefore have to coincide with union terms and be agreed upon mutually before any work takes place. This could be problematic for Krannert's HR, but I believe that since an arts organization, like Krannert, specifically deals with professionals in unions on a regular basis that they are familiar with how to effectively deal with union rules and terms/conditions without too much trouble.
