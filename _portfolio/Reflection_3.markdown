* Analyze an advertisement for your chosen organization, based on the core concepts of marketing.
* Can you determine a target market for your organization?
* Can you define a core consumer need and how your organization is trying to meet that need?
* What else can you ascertain about your organization based on this advertisement? 	

In Lesson 3, I learned about the marketing management process and strategic planning, similar to Lesson 2, but in more detail. I learned more about specific aspects of marketing in Chapter 2 of <u>Marketing â€“ An Introduction</u>. For example, determining target consumers of a company can be found through analyzing market segmentation, marget targeting, and market positioning. Along with these three aspects of marketing comes the marketing mix, which uses the 4 P's (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) to gain the target audience/consumer's attention and business. Also, at the end of Chapter 2, the contents of a marketing plan was discussed in relation to aiding these other parts of marketing to successful completion.

In general, a target market for Krannert, in my opinion, depends on the type of event being presented at the time. For example, a youth concert's target audience would be the youth and their parents in the community. But a target audience for a more general symphony orchestra concert is not as clear. I think past trends show that an older audience is more present at orchestra concerts but that demographic is not necessarily the target audience. I believe Krannert tries to appeal to a wide demographic through advertising and other techniques in order to draw in the widest audience rather than a specific target audience to some performances that more than one type of social group can enjoy. 

A consumer need that is present in the Champaign-Urbana community is the availability of high arts. However, I believe this need is present in most communities right now, not just in Urbana. Krannert is trying to meet this need by making performances and events as accessible to the community as possible through low cost tickets (student/senior/youth discounts) and additional events held by Krannert for the community to gain access to the performers like the after parties held last year. Krannert also meets this need for art in the community through programming a wide variety of cultural events and performances, as shown in my chosen advertisement. 

Here is the link to the video advertisement that I watched: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgWtsgKa-Mg">Krannert Center 2012-13</a>.

In terms of my specific advertisement, the video presented these words/names: bold, spontaneous, classic, cutting edge, La Excelencia, Circus Oz, Monterey Jazz Festival on Tour, Streb. This video was advertising ticket sales through the use of listing names of performance groups and words that describe Krannert and the events that will be held. Through listing words like "cutting edge" and "classic," Krannert was trying to appeal to a younger demographic while also trying to draw in an older audience. However, the video's images appealed to a younger audience because of the outdoor activities that younger people do during the summer. Also, through this advertisement, Krannert successfully and concisely told their audience when tickets go on sale, which was the main goal of the video; to let people know what performances will be held, and when you can buy tickets. I believe this video is an example of effective and simple advertising.
