</ol></ol><b>Potential External Benefactors/Donors:</b>
<ul>
<li>Here are some potential donors/investors who might be good prospects for Krannert:</li>
<ul>
<li>Community Foundation of East Central Illinois</li>
<ul>
<li>They have already donated a large sum of money to the CU Symphony, which performs at Krannert. This type of donor is a collection of donors that forms a foundation that gives to causes around East Central Illinois (like Urbana-Champaign). Also, this foundation specifically donates to the arts. </li>
</ul>
<li>NewsTalk 1400 WDWS, Lite Rock 97.5 WHMS &amp; Classics Hits 107.9</li>
<ul>
<li>The media is an essential member of the public, and can sway public opinion rather easily. A donor or investor like radio stations or other public media outlets would be beneficial to Krannert and will show the public that the media has an interest in the arts. Also, through donations to Krannert, this might mean that Krannert might be advertised more on these stations or media outlets like their website.</li>
</ul>
<li>Banks in Champaign-Urbana</li>
<ul>
<li>Donations from banks could be another source of donations for Krannert.</li>
</ul>
<li>In general, local businesses around the area. </li>
<ul>
<li>Donating to Krannert might be a good business idea for local companies since Krannert advertises supporters in the concert programs and on the website. This would be good publicity, especially since a lot of times, people who are coming to Krannert have extra money to spend on entertainment, and therefore extra money to spend at their business. </li>
