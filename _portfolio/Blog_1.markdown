* Access the mission, vision, and values of your selected organization (if you have difficulty finding the organization's vision or values, derive their values from the content of their online materials; you can ascertain a great deal about an organization's values by their online content). Based on what you've learned, evaluate your organization's mission, vision, and values.

#### Krannert Center Mission & Vision:

* Krannert Center for the Performing Arts is dedicated to the advancement of education, research, and public engagement through the pursuit of excellence and innovation in the performing arts.
* Embracing the art of the past as well as the art of our time, the Center supports the belief that creativity is a core human characteristic and that the arts hold uniquely transformativepotential.
* Through its multiple and integrated roles as classroom, laboratory, and public square, KrannertCenter serves as a touchstone for the exploration and expansion of human experience.

I think Krannert's website presents very clear and concise mission and vision statements. Not only are the statements clear, but the statements are presented on their website in such a way that it is very easy to find. The mission and vision statements are logically located under the "Meet Us" portion of the homepage and then located within the "Mission and Vision" subpage.

I find it fitting that Krannert employees put the mission and vision statements within the "Meet Us" section of the website. Because that is what mission and vision statements should do. Consumers should be able to theoretically "meet" the business and learn what the organization is setting out to do through reading these statements.

My only suggestion to make this subpage on Krannert's website more effective and visible to a consumer is to hyperlink to the mission subpage through other pages that mention something having to do with working towards the vision/mission. For example, the mission and vision page could behyperlinked within the "Volunteer" subpage in order to increase a potential volunteer's awareness of the true values that Krannert has in their everyday business and to become a more informed consumer. The knowledge gained by a volunteer from understanding Krannert's mission would trickle down the ladder through their conversations with patrons and other community members during their shifts, for example. This could potentially influence attendance by a patron in the future.

However, I do not believe that the statements need to be rewritten. I do think there is always room for improvement involving clarity and syntax, but in its current state, I think the statements present a clear and accurate goal set that Krannert has set forth to accomplish.
