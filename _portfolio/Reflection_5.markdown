title: Statement of Activity & Balance Sheet
description: Lesson Reflection 5 - Cultural and Social Trends and the Affect on Krannert Center

* Prepare an annual financial report for a hypothetical dance company, showing the information in the standard form of a Balance Sheet and a Statement of Activity.

In Lesson 5, I learned about budgets and fiscal management within arts organizations and in relation to Krannert, specifically. In Chapter 9 of <u>Management and the Arts</u>, I learned about the types of budgets an organization might use and how they would be implemented and why. The most interesting aspect about this section was learning how each type of budget might affect programming of an arts organization and why this might happen. In Chapter 10, I learned about how the economy affects arts organizations, and how an arts organization might handle finances in different types of economic situations. The most interesting aspect of this chapter, to me, and a question we answered on the Arts Management blog, was about demand and supply within the arts based on the economy's affect on the population and arts consumers. As a future arts administrator, I would love to learn more about the financial aspect of running an arts organization because I feel properly handled finances is what makes or breaks a season or organization.
