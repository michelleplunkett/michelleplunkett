* The RAND Corporation Report states that in the early 20th Century, there was a split between audiences who wanted to attend the recorded "popular" arts (movies, music, etc.) and the live "high" arts, and that prices increased for the high arts.
* Can you explain why prices increased?
* How does this split affect your organization?
* Does your organization present popular arts or high arts or a combination?

The prices increased because the people who chose to continue to support the "high" arts had to accept higher prices in order to maintain the supply of the art that they preferred. This was also when the new model for arts organizations began to develop. Nonprofit arts organizations were now a way for people to distinguish themselves in society through their tastes in art.

I believe that the Krannert Center (opened in 1969) was most affected by the Ford Foundation movement in the 1950s. The creation of Krannert allowed Central Illinois to be a highly functioning supporter of the "high" arts by providing a regional destination for artists previously based of out NYC or other metropolitan areas. However, I do think that Krannert was affected by the split between "high" arts and "popular" arts. This is seen through the gradual rise in prices despite the "high" arts growth throughout the second half of the 20th century.

For example, the price of admission for a UI Student for the "Dedication Concert" at Krannert on April 19, 1969 was $1.50 and $2.50 for the general public which can be seen in the picture below (Dedication Concert Tickets, 1969). With inflation accounted for (by using an inflation calculator), the price would still only be $9.67 if a similar UI Student ticket was sold today. This is especially remarkable because this is almost the current price of a UI Student ticket, which is $10 for most events and concerts. The dedication of Krannert to maintain a low cost of admission for current UI Students is unmatched.

However, not only was this the dedication concert held to open Krannert officially, but the concert featured famous musicians like Tossy Spivakovsky (a virtuoso violinist). Spivakovsky, most likely, was not cheap to hire even in the 1960s. So it is impressive that the cost was still low to attend the dedication even when renowned artists were invited to perform.

However, nowadays, a ticket to attend a concert at Krannert at the same magnitude of the 1969 dedication concert will set an adult back around $50 today ($7.76 in 1969). So, the cost of a ticket to attend a comparable event at Krannert today is around 3 times more expensive ($7.76 divided by $2.50) than when Krannert first opened. The price increase is very clear when put in this context. However, it is worth noting that the price could have been lower for the Dedication Concert through the support of sponsor funding and from Mr. and Mrs. Krannert's direct contribution. But I think the price increase seen in this example is still relevant.

I think that the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts presents a combination of popular arts and high arts. Krannert features classical music from world-renown symphonies and orchestras while also embracing a popular music culture. Popular music can be seen at the biyearly guitar festival held at Krannert called ELLNORA. Artists that are not considered to be "high" art can be seen at this festival like the Punch Brothers and Bela Fleck. (Speaking of which, ELLNORA is named after Mrs. Krannert, whose first name is Ellnora.) However, during the August-May school year, I do think mostly "high" art like classical music concerts are featured, especially since our own School of Music uses Foellinger Great Hall almost exclusively for major ensemble concerts.

Here's a bonus picture of the construction on Krannert's Great Hall, just because I think it is super cool and interesting.

By the way, for anyone who is wondering, I received these pictures and information about Krannert from the UIUC Archives while I was doing research for RHET 105 (a freshman writing course). There is a scrapbook currently held in the UIUC Undergrad Library Archives that contains all of the newspaper clippings and items (like the tickets I feature in this post) from the grand opening of Krannert. I would highly suggest checking it out if you have some free time!
