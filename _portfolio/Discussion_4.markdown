* Based on this module's reading and what you know about your chosen organization, what type of organizational structure might they have?

<!--more-->

According to the Krannert website's subpage listing of staff member's names and biographies, employees are placed into groups or departments. This means that Krannert's organization structure is based on a "divisional structure" where employees are grouped into separate business units and divisions. Specifically, I believe that Krannert Center functions under the specific, "Product Departmentalization" divisional structure. Meaning that each department is under control of one product that the business creates and is overseen by a manager of that department.

According to a website I found and the Management textbook, some advantages to having a divisional structure include accountability of each department to manage and create their individual product and it affords greater flexibility within each department. However, along with these advantages comes problems like a lack of communication between departments or redundancy among work efforts.

Here is a list of the departments that Krannert has divided their employees into:

* Senior Management
* Director's Office
* Marketing and Patron Services
* Ticket Office
* Promenade
* Food Services
* FAA IT Liaisons
* Business Office
* Building Operations
* Events
* Production
* Development

Here is a picture of how I think a hierarchical diagram would look for Krannert (This is just my idea, not necessarily how Krannert is run currently.):
