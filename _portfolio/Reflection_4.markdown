description: Lesson Reflection 4 - Arts Administration

* In previous modules, we learned about conducting an internal and external analysis.
* What important human resource factors should be incorporated into this analysis?

In Lesson 4, I learned about the organizational structure and personnel management of companies in general, and then related these concepts back to arts organizations like Krannert Center. In Chapter 10 of <u>Management</u>, I learned a great amount of definitions that are involved with the organization and structure of organizations and types of organizations based on the company's purpose or product. Along with these concepts, we also learned the pros and cons to each type of organizational structure and how one type might work better for one type of organization over another. In Chapter 12 of <u>Management</u>, I learned what the Human Resource Management (HRM) process is and how it affects how an organization runs and does business. This includes learning about how to select employees, factors than can affect the HRM process, training employees, and maintaining highly competent employees within the organization. Throughout our blog posts and discussions, we discussed how these concepts might be shown through our chosen organization.

In a previous module, we conducted a SWOT analysis that is essentially an internal and external analysis of the factors than can affect an organization. Below is my SWOT analysis and underneath each bullet point includes Human Resource factors that are involved with a few.

#### **SWOT Analysis - Krannert Center for the Performing Arts**

<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Strengths</strong></li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Multiple performance halls</li>
          <ul type="square">
            <li><b>HR Factors:</b></li>
             <ul type="circle">
             <li>Handicap accessibility is a huge factor in running a performance hall and making sure patrons and guests of all backgrounds can enjoy a performance in the hall.</li>
             <li>Employing people to run and maintain the performance hall without discrimination is another Human Resource factor involved with running a hall. Some examples of employees that would need to be hired to run the hall are janitors, stage crew, lighting designers, audio techs, ushers, etc. All of these people will need to go through HR to be hired.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>  
    <li>High quality facility</li>
    <li>Location on the University of Illinois campus</li>
    <li>Organized and dedicated staff</li>
          <ul type="square">
            <li><b>HR Factors:</b></li>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>These people will need to be hired without discrimination and through the HRM process in order to maintain a high quality performing arts facility.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul> 
   <li>High quality programming</li>
          <ul type="square">
            <li><b>HR Factors:</b></li>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>Again, hiring performers can sometimes be a tricky business, as I mentioned in my Arts Organization Discussion Post. For example, in order to hire Equity actors, HR will have to work and collaborate with the union in order to make sure the terms of their contract will be followed.</li>
                <li>Along with this, in order for a performing arts facility to hold performances, HR and other departments have to make sure all copyright laws are being followed, and a lot of times that means detailed record keeping needs to be maintained.</li>
             </ul>
          </ul>  
    <li>Ticketing services easy</li>
  </ul>  
<li><strong>Internal Weaknesses</strong></li>
 <ul type="circle">
    <li>Focus on volunteers for ushers (could be problematic)</li>
      <ul type="square">
        <li><b>HR Factors:</b></li>
          <ul type="circle">
            <li>A focus on volunteers could be problematic from an HR standpoint, especially if an usher behaves in a way that is unprofessional.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>    
      <li>Limited public engagement with board</li>
  </ul>  
<li><strong> External Opportunities</strong></li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Growing population within university</li>
    <li>Educational programming with schools</li>
    <li>Collaborate more with the local music/performing arts colleges and students</li>
  </ul>  
<li><strong>External Threats</strong></li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Aging arts audience</li>
    <li>Changing ways audiences like to view entertainment (internet, etc.)</li>
    <li>Lower amount of spending from audiences for "high-arts" entertainment, especially in current economic state</li>
    <li>Entertainment streaming websites like Hulu, Netflix, Qello ("high-arts" streaming website like Netflix)</li>
  </ul>  
</ul>
