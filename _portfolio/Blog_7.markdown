* Discuss "The Death of the Artist—and the Birth of the Creative Entrepreneur."
* How do you think the changes will affect your organization and the arts field as a whole?

After reading the article, "The Death of the Artist—and the Birth of the Creative Entrepreneur," my first thought was that this author clearly views the current state of the artistic world as being more of a business to gain an income and a network than as a creative outlet for artists. William Deresiewicz, the author, also highly romanticizes the 18th/19th and even 20th century views of art. He uses phrases like, "The artisan became the genius: solitary, like a holy man; inspired, like a prophet; in touch with the unseen, his consciousness bulging into the future," to describe how the artist was viewed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The diction he uses shows that either he thought the artist was romanticized in these centuries or he thought that the people of the time romanticized artists (or poets, playwrights, painters, etc, since he describes that there's a difference). As the article moves into discussing the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century, it's clear that he thinks that "art" as a creative outlet is becoming "lowered" in a way through the use of the Internet. Even his diction becomes more negative. For example he uses these terms to describe the current state of the arts: downsizing, collapsing, handling, intense, less robust.

In my opinion, I believe the author is biased. I think he is putting his own personal feelings about what "true" art is (in this case, art from the 18th/19th centuries) into this article and not viewing art created in the 20th/21st centuries as objective as he could. Not only are the words featuring a negative connotation, he also degrades the current state of artists through saying that they are "no longer interested in putting in their 10,000 hours," which belittles the 21st century artist's work efforts. He also belittles the current trend in today's artists where they try to "diversify" themselves, and almost condemns artists to not sticking to one craft. A quote that stuck with me as especially degrading is, "Now you're only as good as your last sales quarter."

I agree with Deresiewicz's opinion that we are now living in the "age of the customer," but I do not believe that just because the customer is highly valued as being the main financial contributor to the arts in this time period that the art that is created is any less "high" or "good" than what the "masters" created in the 18th/19th centuries.

I think the technological affects that Deresiewicz discusses are already apparent at Krannert Center and at many other similar arts organizations. It seems that Krannert and other places are forced to advertise more and more to the consumer in order to persuade them to attend an event or concert. The appearance of entire arts organizations on social media are growing more every year, through the forceful affect of the consumer's need to always know what's going on each second of the day. This has also affected an artist's creative process, definitely. However, I believe that the more intimate collaboration with an artist's audience and the art itself has been beneficial overall.

In the end, art only becomes famous if support and enjoyment comes from the audience. This will mean the artist has to put him or herself out there in different ways, which is a pretense of our current time and societal ideals, however, I disagree with Deresiewiczthat the art that is being "produced" is just made to make money and is lower in quality than our predecessors. One does not choose to make art for the sake of financial stability, in any century.
