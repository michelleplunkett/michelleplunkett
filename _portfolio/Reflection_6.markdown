* How do changing demographics in society affect fundraising for your organization?

In Lesson 6, I learned about how fundraising is managed within arts organizations and how fundraising can affect how an organization is run and how it could potentially affect programming. I first learned about the history of giving and trends of giving in the arts (it used to not be common place to donate to the arts). I learned extensively about how and why people give to the arts and to causes in general and what it takes to maintain a successful donor relationship. Overall, a case for support is an integral part of an organization's fundraising strategy, as it is the persuading reason to get donations and why the fundraising is happening in the first place. My favorite quote from Chapter 12 of <u>Management and the Arts</u> is, "Successful fundraising is the right person asking the right prospect for the right amount for the right project at the right time in the right way."

Changing demographics affects fundraising in many ways, especially for arts organizations. In regards to Krannert, changing demographics in society could either increase or decrease the amount of funds raised. For example, a younger demographic vs. the older generation affects fundraising greatly. According to a source, people born before 1946 represent the majority of donors in a fundraising campaign while people born within the last 50 years are still not active in the giving community. Millenials (like myself) are not active at all yet but will be the most affected by technology in terms of how we will give in the future. So, a college town like Urbana could affect fundraising in Krannert. Urbana (using the August-May school year) has an overall younger demographic, so fundraising might be not as effective during this time. However, the older generation is still very present, especially at "high arts" performances like the CSO and the CUSO. However, the demographic of Champaign-Urbana is not changing greatly anytime soon, as long as UIUC continues to thrive as a Big 10 school.
