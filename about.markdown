My name is **Michelle Plunkett**.

I am a second year graduate student in the Master of Public Affairs program at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin. I am also a member of the Arts & Cultural Management & Entrepreneurship Certificate Program. I will graduate with my degree and certificate in May of 2018. 

In May of 2016, I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I completed a Bachelor of Arts in Music Technology degree with Highest Honors (*Summa Cum Laude*, GPA above 3.75 and top 6% of college's class) and Bronze Tablet Honors (top 3% of entire university graduating class). I completed this four-year program in only three years. 

During the summer of 2017, I worked as a Research Intern in Washington, D.C. at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in the Office of Research & Analysis. This internship was the perfect complement to my degree program and interests and I highly enjoyed the challenging and rewarding work.

I currently work as the Senior Policy Analyst at Indeed.com in Austin, Texas. Focused on high quality user experiences, at Indeed I use my skills to write, implement, and evaluate influential policies at the global scale.

My current interests include using data to inform decision-making through [visualizations](https://michelle-plunkett.com/projects/IMLS_Museums_Map/), [mapping](https://michelle-plunkett.com/projects/Raised_Median_Maps/) and [data analysis](https://michelle-plunkett.com/projects/Final_Statistical_Analysis/). Additionally, I am actively learning new programming languages and statistical analysis software like [Stata](https://michelle-plunkett.com/projects/aem-problem-set-4/) & [R/R Studio](https://michelle-plunkett.com/notebooks/2017-08-17-shapefiles-to-csv/) to improve my research skills and become well-versed on how to make data-driven decisions. 

I know how to program using Python R (but R is my preferred language), and understand how to implement open-source libraries (like D3.js, Leaflet, and others) to visualize data on the web. Most recently, I made [this website for TTI](https://michelle-plunkett.com/projects/Raised_Median_Maps/) using RMarkdown's "flex dashboard" package.

Additionally, I have multiple years of experience in web development and design, search engine optimization, internet marketing, and e-commerce. I host and maintain my personal website on [GitHub](https://github.com/michelleplunkett) and write the majority of the website's code in languages such as MarkDown, HTML & CSS. Most recently, I designed (based on user experience design best practices) and maintained [Berdoll Sawmill's website](https://berdollsawmill.com) using WordPress, HTML, CSS and writing custom WordPress plug-ins. I increased web traffic by 200% in 5 months by optimizing SEO & SEM strategies through analysis of Google Analytics, AdWords, and competitor website performance data. 

I also optimized a local business's e-commerce website, [Berdoll Pecan Candy & Gift Co.](https://www.berdollpecanfarm.com), by increasing their web traffic by 25% and e-commerce conversions to 7% in 6 months (3% higher than the industry average) through a combination of designing optimal Google AdWords campaigns, A/B testing, and adjusting SEM strategies through keyword analysis.
