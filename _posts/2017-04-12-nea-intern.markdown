I am pleased announce that I have accepted an offer to join the National Endowment for the Arts' Office of Research & Analysis as a Research Intern this summer!

I will have three main duties this summer: 

1. Communications - helping create NEA fact sheets and working with the Public Affairs/Communications department to disseminate these sheets and other information that the ORA creates
2. Statistical Analysis - helping clean and compile data in Stata for an upcoming report and performing statistical analyses using this data
3. Administrative Support - provide administrative support, plan meetings and maintain an event calendar, and perform other tasks as assigned

I am very excited to be in D.C. this summer and working for the NEA. I start on May 22nd and will be working until August 25th. After which I will head back to Austin to start my 2nd year at LBJ.
