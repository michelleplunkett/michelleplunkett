description: A reflection on my summer internship at the National Endowment for the Arts.
---

This summer, I was a Research Intern with the NEA’s Office of Research & Analysis. My internship was made possible through a competitive fellowship program sponsored by my graduate school. I was awarded the **J.J. Pickle Fellowship** which supports LBJ students who intern with federal agencies or congressional offices. Working for the NEA has been a dream of mine since I began my undergraduate program in music. I was very happy to be on the ORA’s team this summer! My work utilized the skills I am learning as a public policy graduate student while also combining my artistic interests. 

During my time at the NEA, I performed a variety of tasks to support the ORA’s various research initiatives. Some of my projects included **compiling data** for **congressional district and state fact sheets**, creating **maps and mapping applications** used to **visualize NEA grant data**, conducting **data quality analyses**, and numerous other administrative tasks. For example, to create the congressional district fact sheets, I analyzed NEA final descriptive report data to create summary impact statistics at the district-level. I also learned how to manipulate other federal datasets like the *American Community Survey’s Public Use Microdata Sample* and the BEA’s *Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account* to emphasize the economic impact of the arts throughout the nation. 

I have now seen first-hand how dedicated the employees at the NEA are towards creating a tangible impact through their grant-making and other programs, and I would like to be a part of the next generation that advocates for artists throughout the U.S.
