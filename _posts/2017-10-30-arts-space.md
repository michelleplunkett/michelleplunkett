description: An Op-Ed on artists and lack of space in Austin, Texas.

Austin is home to over 3,000 cultural assets that reach every nook and cranny of the city. 
From public art collections to creative workspaces, the arts have an undeniable, physical presence. 

Despite this fact, local artists are still 
[unable to afford the spaces](https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2016-05-27/we-cant-make-it-here-anymore/) 
that empower them to add to Austin’s impressive collection. 

While the City has tried multiple times to increase artist space, concurrent and half-baked efforts by 
multiple departments seem to dilute the importance of the issue rather than generate change. This 
begs the question, what is being done about the problem?  

Initiatives like the [Cultural Asset Mapping Project (CAMP)](https://austintexas.gov/department/cultural-asset-mapping-project)
and the [Major’s Resolution on Music and the Creative Ecosystem](https://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2017-02-24/mayors-omnibus-resolution-a-year-later/) 
both share a purpose of informing future planning efforts for Austin’s creative spaces and cultural assets. 
CAMP’s intent is to map the places and resources that are important to Austin’s cultural identity and creativity. 
The Mayor’s Resolution seeks to increase the number of innovation spaces for musicians and other creative artists 
to craft new ideas, called “HUBs.” 

Another new grant program, the [Art Space Assistance Program (ASAP)](austintexas.gov/page/art-space-assistance-program-asap), 
introduced in June, provides funds for tenant improvements or rent stipends to displaced artists or artists who face 
displacement due to rising rent costs. The catch is that the grant only considers applications from nonprofit arts 
organizations, not individual or for-profit artists. 

Various solutions are being thrown at the wall with good intentions, rather than working with existing programs to 
create a coordinated and comprehensive improvement in providing opportunities for artist space.

The City’s current major planning initiative, [CodeNEXT](https://www.austintexas.gov/codenext), neglects to 
consider the CAMP data or the Mayor’s Resolution declarations in draft versions of the code. This is in spite 
of the fact that the code is supposed to reflect the goals of 
[Imagine Austin](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/creativeeconomy), which specifically includes a focus on nurturing 
a thriving creative economy. 

CodeNEXT does not adequately address the increasingly limited availability and affordability of creative space for 
artists. Without space to practice their craft, creatives will inevitably leave Austin. 

According to the CAMP data, a little over 40 out of the more than 3,000 cultural assets in Austin are creative workspaces 
available for public use. However, the quality of the CAMP dataset is questionable at best. CAMP started in 2014 but 
has not been updated since 2016. Consequently, many of these spaces or cultural assets are no longer in existence. 
Partially because of the rising rent. 

Regardless of the data quality issues, mapping the CAMP data reveals that creative workspaces tend to be located 
near downtown, leaving East and Southeast Austin to fend for themselves.

The City of Austin needs to prioritize the development of creative workspaces available for public use on the East 
and Southeast sides of the city, specifically in city council districts 1 and 2. One solution includes adding 
specific language into the code that is inclusive of CAMP data.

Reviewing the CodeNEXT language reveals that while live/work spaces have been added into zoning considerations, 
cultural institutions are more broadly defined than before. A 
[project manager with the city’s Cultural Arts Division](http://kut.org/post/how-will-codenext-apply-arts-spaces-austin) states that 
“having those more nuanced definitions makes sure that we can fit the right venue, fit the right cultural, 
creative space in the right place, in the right zone.”  

While this may sound like a step in the right direction, a new land use designation, 
“Studio: Art, Dance, Martial Arts, Music,” is definitely not “nuanced” in its title. This use relates only to spaces used 
for the *instruction of students*. Additionally, spaces that fall under this land use are not permitted in any of the 
new residential house-scale zones and conditionally allowed in the residential multi-unit zones. Only in mixed-use zones 
will creatives wishing to build studios and creative spaces experience no headaches related to land development code 
restrictions. Even the new “Library, Museum, or Public Art Gallery,” land use designation will require a special 
permit in these zones. 

However, CodeNEXT may continue to inhibit artists from affording spaces in these areas even after these considerations 
are added. 

The eventual disappearance of artists could challenge the city’s identity as a creative hub, which helped drive 
people to Austin in the first place.

Rather than making more “nuanced” codes, the city needs to bolster the arts community by designating areas for 
development of creative spaces, guided by gaps revealed in the CAMP data.
