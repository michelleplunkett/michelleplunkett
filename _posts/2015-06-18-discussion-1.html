<p>The prices increased because the people who chose to continue to support the "high" arts had to accept higher prices in order to maintain the supply of the art that they preferred. This was also when the new model for arts organizations began to develop. Nonprofit arts organizations were now a way for people to distinguish themselves in society through their tastes in art.</p>

<p>I believe that the Krannert Center (opened in 1969) was most affected by the Ford Foundation movement in the 1950s. The creation of Krannert allowed Central Illinois to be a highly functioning supporter of the "high" arts by providing a regional destination for artists previously based of out NYC or other metropolitan areas. However, I do think that Krannert was affected by the split between "high" arts and "popular" arts. This is seen through the gradual rise in prices despite the "high" arts growth throughout the second half of the 20th century.</p> 

<p>For example, the price of admission for a UI Student for the "Dedication Concert" at Krannert on April 19, 1969 was $1.50 and $2.50 for the general public which can be seen in the picture below (Dedication Concert Tickets, 1969). With inflation accounted for (by using an inflation calculator), the price would still only be $9.67 if a similar UI Student ticket was sold today. This is especially remarkable because this is almost the current price of a UI Student ticket, which is $10 for most events and concerts. The dedication of Krannert to maintain a low cost of admission for current UI Students is unmatched.</p>

<p>However, not only was this the dedication concert held to open Krannert officially, but the concert featured famous musicians like Tossy Spivakovsky (a virtuoso violinist). Spivakovsky, most likely, was not cheap to hire even in the 1960s. So it is impressive that the cost was still low to attend the dedication even when renowned artists were invited to perform.<p>
