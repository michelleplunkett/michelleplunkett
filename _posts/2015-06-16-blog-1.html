<p>Other developing trends that have occurred in the field since the report was published include the trends in technology and how it affects the online presence of an arts organization. The Internet was still just developing to be the massive system that it is now in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, around when this report was published. The developing Internet trend was discussed briefly in the summary section of the reading but I think it is worth discussing in greater detail since the growth has been so large. I think that since the early 2000s, the development of social media and the availability of technology to consumers has affected the growth of the performing arts and entertainment fields.</p>

<p>Marketing for performing arts organizations, through the aid of social media on the Internet, now has an audience of more than just people that live near the arts center or organization. I believe that through social media, new and larger audiences in more than one location have been created. This can especially be seen with Twitter. A consumer can follow the daily doings and happenings at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, or even our very own Krannert Center from the comfort of their own home thousands of miles away from New York City or Urbana.</p>

<p>Not only can a consumer follow a performing arts center on Twitter, but they can directly contact the arts center through this medium. This means they potentially have the ability to affect what is performed or things that the consumer would like to see happen at the arts organization. Also, the arts center has the ability now to receive direct, unfiltered, feedback from consumers in real-time. The trends in social media are affecting the performing arts and entertainment field by allowing the consumer to have more control over how they spend their money.</p>

<p>I think it would be cool for more arts organizations to have applications on mobile devices. I think the use of mobile technology is limited right now in the arts industry, and I think they are missing out on a opportunity to advertise performances even more to new audiences. For example, the Starbucks app knows when you are near a Starbucks through GPS locating. A performing arts center application could notify someone when they are near the arts center and send them a small list of upcoming performances with a link to buy tickets. Real-time advertising like notifications could affect the audience demographics drastically.</p>
