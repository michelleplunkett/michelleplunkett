I am very excited to announce that I have been selected as a J.J. "Jake" Pickle Endowed Fellow for the summer of 2017!

I was selected on the basis of the quality of my internship opportunity and the promise that LBJ sees in me as a future leader in the field of public policy. 

There are only a few more weeks left until I will be traveling to Washington, D.C. to start my work as a Research Intern with the National Endowment for the Arts in the Office of Research & Analysis.
