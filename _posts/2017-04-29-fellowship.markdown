---

I am very excited to announce that I have been selected as a J.J. "Jake" Pickle Endowed Fellow for the summer of 2017!

I was selected on the basis of the quality of my internship opportunity and the promise that LBJ sees in me as a future leader in the field of public policy. 

There are only a few more weeks left until I will be traveling to Washington, D.C. to start my work as a Research Intern with the National Endowment for the Arts in the Office of Research & Analysis.

**J.J. "Jake" Pickle Internship Fellowship:**

> Former Congressman J.J. “Jake” Pickle served the 10th District of Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives for over thirty years. His close association with former President Lyndon B. Johnson inspired the creation of this endowment to enable promising students who share Congressman Pickle’s lifelong dedication to public service.

**Criteria:** *“These funds will help support students as interns in congressional offices or on federal and state committee and agency staffs.”*
