In June 2018, I will start my new career as a Senior Search Quality Risk Operations Policy Analyst at Indeed.com! 

I am very excited to sart this new job and am looking forward to working towards achieving Indeed's mission of helping people get jobs. 
As Senior Policy Analyst, I will work on reviewing existing Indeed content policies, identify gaps in implementation of said policies, and make improvements via policy revision and development.
